# Adrift app

__<a href="https://adrift.city/" target="_blank">Adrift</a>__ is an experimental and artistic research-based web application for **walking in the city**.

Adrift deconstructs Google Maps directions text* and by doing so it offers a new set of directions based on the original one, thus it enables the performers to get lost in their very own environment. "Getting lost" refers to the perception of the urban fabric in a different way than what we usually experience in **everyday life**.

During the walk (or run, play, etc.) to nowhere, the performers are being asked a set of questions regarding the surrounding and offered the opportunity to record the answers in the form of conversations between them, hoping to initiate another level of observation and meaning-making through the act of walking and mapping.

_* The directions text (generated by the Google Maps Directions API) is accessible by sharing the selected **walking route** on Maps mobile app (See the instructions)._ <br>
_As Google Cloud requires payment methods to grant MAPS API Key (and services that provide search, directions, etc.) it is more liberating to use Adrift only on devices with already installed Google Maps to attain the directions text from._

## Development

The app [stores data locally](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Client-side_storage) (only on the device) following the four basic operations of persistent storage [create, read, update and delete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (CRUD).

The app is built with React and hosted with Netlify.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/23eaaa27-d296-45ed-bd85-8316aa1138ca/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/adriftapp/deploys)

Unlike the initial Vanilla JS version, this app is a [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) (PWA) developed with React [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and [Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start).

It also uses more APIs and libraries such as [Dexie.js](https://dexie.org/docs/Dexie/Dexie) as the IndexedDB wrapper, [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API), and [WebKit MediaRecorder API](https://webkit.org/blog/11353/mediarecorder-api/).
